- Wait the build is waiting on step _Publish to Marketplace_
- The vsix is downloadable and can be tested a last time before publishing it to public
- Ensure you are logged in
- Go to the console log of the build and click "Proceed"
- Wait few minutes and check that it has been published on [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-wsdl2rest)
